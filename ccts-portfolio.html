            <p class="flow-text left-align">CCTS was a module done during my short semester and the moduleâ€™s aim was to train my creativity and critical thinking skills. As I am terrible at drawing, I was forced to constantly improvise in order to make up on my lack of artistic skills for my assignments. Despite my terrible drawing, the things that I have learned throughout this module had been eye-opening and I really felt that I have benefitted greatly from doing CCTS. There are a total of three assignments that I was required to do during the whole semester, and I was guided by both Mr Paul and Ms Hanim throughout the whole process. </p>

                <li>Intrapersonal Skills - As I was chosen to be the team leader for <a href="/design-your-own-country.html">Design Your Own Country</a>, I was tasked to motivate my teammates to do their work without too much delays and to ensure satisfactory performance were delivered from them.</li>
                <li>Communication Skills - It is important that I maintain good communication with my teammates so as to reduce the amount misunderstandings that might arise while we were doing our group assignment.</li>
