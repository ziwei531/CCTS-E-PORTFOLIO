                    <p class="flow-text">CCTS was a module done during my short semester and the moduleâ€™s aim was to train my creativity and critical thinking skills. As I am terrible at drawing, I was forced to constantly improvise in order to make up on my lack of artistic skills for my assignments. Despite my terrible drawing, the things that I have learned throughout this module had been eye-opening and I really felt that I have benefitted greatly from doing CCTS. There are a total of three assignments that I was required to do during the whole semester, and I was guided by both Mr Paul and Ms Hanim throughout the whole process. </p>
