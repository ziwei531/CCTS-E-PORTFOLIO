# CCTS-E-PORTFOLIO
E-Portfolio for CCTS

This is a portfolio website made when I was back in Foundation in Computing for the subject of CCTS. The website is definitely not perfect, as this was made by absolute beginner me back when I was in pre-university. 
However, this demonstrated just how much I've progressed with my HTML and CSS were in just one semester worth of time to learn it in addition to being busy with 4 other subjects. 

# Shortcomings
Understandably, there are WAY TOO MANY text especially on the home page. Well, beginners make mistakes. I will strive to ensure user-friendliness in terms of readability will be prioritized in my latest website creations
