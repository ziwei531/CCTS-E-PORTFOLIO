                <p class="flow-text left-align">During the entire course of this module, I have truly gained a lot of new wisdom and knowledge. As I am terrible at drawing, I was forced to constantly improvise in order to make up on my lack of artistic skills for my assignments. Despite my terrible drawing, the things that I have learned throughout this module had been eye-opening and I really felt that I have benefitted greatly from doing CCTS.
